### Guideline for changelog verbs: [^1]

Verb    | Use for...
--------|-----------
Add     | New features, files, or functionality
Remove  | Deprecated or obsolete features/code/files
Change  | Behavior changes or refactors that alter how something works
Update  | Version bumps, metadata changes, or refreshed content (e.g. docs, deps)
Fix     | Bug fixes
Migrate | Moving from one system to another (e.g. `setup.py` -> `pyproject.toml`)
Improve | Enhancements to performance, UX, maintainability, etc.
Refactor | Internal restructuring without changing external behavior
