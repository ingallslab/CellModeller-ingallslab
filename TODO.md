# CellModeller TODOs

Multicellular agent-based modelling framework

Please move finished items to unreleased section of `CHANGELOG.md`

### Planned

 - [ ] Add `CellArrays` class to manage cell data efficiently
   - [ ] Define custom cell attributes using `numpy.dtype` declaration
   - [ ] Preallocate memory for known cell attributes
   - [ ] Manage centralized OpenCL shared memory between modules
     - [ ] Require a context manager to synchronize
   - [ ] Conform to `collection.abc.Sequence` specification to access cells
   - [ ] Provide `memoryview`s to contiguous blocks of cell data for renderers
 - [ ] Change `CellModeller.CellState` implementation
   - [ ] Address underlying `numpy.ndarray` fields with object.attribute syntax
   - [ ] Warn users about using undefined cell attributes
 - [ ] Add new `CellModeller.Modules.ModuleProtocols`
   - [ ] Support for custom cell events and flexible sim loop updates
 - [ ] Add OpenGL retained mode classes and shaders
   - [ ] Base wrapper class that handles shader compiling and memory management
   - [ ] Allow renderers to define cell attributes for intended cell types
 - [ ] Change `CellModeller.Simulator` implementation
   - [ ] Integrate with `ModuleProtocol` and `UserModule` classes
   - [ ] Check for custom cell events in update loop
   - [ ] Forward access layer for renderers to cell data

### Working On

### Guideline for changelog verbs: [^1]

Verb    | Use for...
--------|-----------
Add     | New features, files, or functionality
Remove  | Deprecated or obsolete features/code/files
Change  | Behavior changes or refactors that alter how something works
Update  | Version bumps, metadata changes, or refreshed content (e.g. docs, deps)
Fix     | Bug fixes
Migrate | Moving from one system to another (e.g. `setup.py` -> `pyproject.toml`)
Improve | Enhancements to performance, UX, maintainability, etc.
Refactor | Internal restructuring without changing external behavior
