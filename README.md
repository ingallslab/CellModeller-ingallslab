**CellModeller** is a Python-based framework for modeling large-scale multicellular
systems such as biofilms, plant and animal tissues. It enables simulation of
cellular growth, division, biophysics, gene regulation, and intercellular
signalling through customizable models written in Python.

## üì¶ Installation

We recommend using **Conda** to manage your environment:

```bash
conda create -n cellmodeller python=3.10
conda activate cellmodeller
```

Clone and install the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ingallslab/CellModeller-ingallslab.git
cd CellModeller
pip install -e .
```

---

## üíª Running the GUI

Launch the GUI:

```bash
python CellModeller/Scripts/CellModellerGUI.py
```

### GUI Buttons
- **Load Model** ‚Äì Choose a model script to simulate
- **Load Pickle** ‚Äì Load saved simulation states
- **Reset Simulation** ‚Äì Restart the simulation
- **Run** ‚Äì Start/resume the simulation
- **Save Pickle** ‚Äì Toggle saving simulation data

### Keyboard Controls
- Move: `WASD`, `QE`, arrow keys
- Rotate: `IJKL`, `UO`
- Zoom: Scroll wheel
- Mouse drag: look around
- Right-click: move camera

### Running Models from CLI

You can also run models directly:

```bash
python Scripts/CellModellerGUI.py Examples/KyleP/Tutorial_1a.py
```

## üß¨ Writing Your Own Models

A CellModeller *model* is a Python script that defines:
- Simulation parameters
- Initial cell states and types
- Growth and interaction rules
- Modules (e.g. biophysics, signaling)

Explore the [`Examples/`](./Examples/KyleP) folder for real model templates.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Our tutorials are a work in progress and may be slightly outdated ‚Äî updates are on the way!

## üß∞ Documentation

You can generate local documentation using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/):

```bash
doxygen ./doxygenconfig
```

Then open the docs at:

```bash
html/index.html
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>
No UserModule found in ...
</summary>
Note that a lot of the old examples use deprecated parts of the application, so
will not work until rewritten using the new API.

If you are using the new API:
1. Check if there is a subclass of UserModule in the given path.
2. Check if it is a concrete implementation or an abstract class by
instantiating it either at the top level of the file or in an interactive shell.
> If not, remember to implement the abstract methods sim_step() and
on_sim_ready(), even if they are empty functions!
</details>

<details>
<summary>
pyopencl has no attribute SVM
</summary>
This error has appeared on some Apple silicon Mac computers. Currently no
workarounds exist, rollback to v4.3.1. We are working on a fix.
</details>

Think your problem runs deeper than that?
Open an [issue](https://github.com/ingallslab/CellModeller-ingallslab/issues) on GitHub,
mentioning what you've tried and what you expect to happen.
