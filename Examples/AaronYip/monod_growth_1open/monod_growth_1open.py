'''
This is a demo simulation for growth in a microfluidic device, where cell growth is determined by a limiting nutrient. The nutrient field is consumed proportionally to the cell growth rate.

The nutrient field u is calculated based on the species transport equation, where du/dt and advection are neglected:

D*laplace(u) = -mu_max*u*VolumeFraction()/(u+K)

This model is valid if cell growth is the limiting time scale. The nutrient field can be calculated separately to a pseudo steady-state.
The volume fraction is computed based on the cell center (i.e. a point within a mesh element). The element size must be >= the length scale of a bacterium.

The geometry is as follows:

|___________________________________|

Domain size is 80 X 80 um. 
In the solver, the domain is extended by two elements to ensure that cells do not touch the boundary elements.
Bacteria on the open boundary elements will make the solver fail as we will be placing a source term into elements with Dirichlet BCs, causing a very steep gradient that the solver cannot handle.

The dolfin solver is based on the work of William P.J. Smith: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Jan 2017, 114 (3) E280-E286; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1613007114

The PDESolver setup for this module is in monod_growth_1open_DolfinPDESolver.py.
