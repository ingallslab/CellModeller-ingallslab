## Fork and Pull Request

For people that may want to change the code to solve a bug or add a new feature for example we suggest to fork the project, implement the changes and make a pull request.
If you fork the project and adapt it to your usage we strongly reccommend to make a pull request to implement this usage for other users. 

## New Branch and Pull Request

For recurrent contributors we will add them to the organization and provide authorization to edit. 
To contribute make a new branch, if you dont know which branch use as base create one from master, implement your changes and make a pull request.
With this we avoid that the project diverge from forks and incentivate a culture of continuous contribution.
